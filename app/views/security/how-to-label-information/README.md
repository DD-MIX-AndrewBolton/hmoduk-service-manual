You need to label information correctly so that people understand how to protect and share it.


{{ modukList({
  "title": 'Do',
  "type": 'tick',
  "items": [
    {
      "item": 'Write security classifications in all capitals'
    },
    {
      "item": 'Clearly label all SECRET and TOP SECRET information'
    }
  ]
}) }}

{{ modukList({
  "title": 'Donâ€™t',
  "type": 'cross',
  "items": [
    {
      "item": 'classify information higher than it needs'
    },
    {
      "item": 'use OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE as a security classification'
    }
  ]
}) }}

### How to label OFFICIAL information

You do not have to label OFFICIAL information. 

However, if the information can be printed you should label it as OFFICIAL at the top and bottom of each page.
  

#### Do not over classify OFFICIAL information

If you classify information higher than it needs, people may struggle to access it. For example, services classified as SECRET do not let users access the internet.

Managing SECRET information is at least 10 times more expensive than OFFICIAL information.

### Use OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE correctly

OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE is not a security classification. It is a label used to identify sensitive information stored on OFFICIAL systems.

Using OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE as a security classification can lead to dangerous practices including:

- all data being treated as equally sensitive
- designing systems to protect all types of sensitive data when they only handle some sensitive data or none at all

{{ govukInsetText({
  text: "Only use OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE as a label if have evidence to support your decision."
}) }}


#### Add information to OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE

If there is a clear case to use OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE, you need to add more information to the label. 

For example: OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE [descriptor].

Use the core descriptors recommended by The Cabinet Office:

- COMMERCIAL for market-sensitive information like price negotiations and system vulnerabilities
- LOCSEN for sensitive information that staff engaged overseas cannot access
- PERSONAL for sensitive information that can be linked to an individual

### How to Label SECRET and TOP SECRET information

{{ govukInsetText({
  text: "You must clearly label SECRET and TOP SECRET information."
}) }}

You should include the SECRET or TOP SECRET label in the subject line of emails. If the information can be printed out, add the label to the top and bottom of each page.

If you share SECRET or TOP-SECRET information internationally, you need to add more details to the label.
