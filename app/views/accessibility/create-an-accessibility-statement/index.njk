<div class="mod-prose">

  <p>Since 2018, all public sector websites and applications must include an accessibility statement. It needs to be published before your product or service goes into public beta.</p>

  <p>The statement needs to cover:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>whether your website or mobile app is ‘fully’, ‘partially’ or ‘not’ compliant with accessibility standards</li>
    <li>if it’s not fully compliant, which parts do not meet accessibility standards and why. For example, because they are exempt or it would be a disproportionate burden to fix</li>
    <li>how people can get alternatives to content that’s not accessible to them</li>
    <li>how to contact you to report accessibility problems - and a link to the website that they can use if they’re not happy with your response</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You can use this <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/model-accessibility-statement" rel="external nofollow">model accessibility statement</a>.</p>

  <p>If you can, work with a content designer to make sure your statement is written in plain English.</p>

  <h2 id="things-you-might-not-need-to-fix">Things you might not need to fix</h2>

  <p>Your team does not need to fix the following types of content because they’re exempt from the accessibility regulations:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>pre-recorded audio and video published before 23 September 2020</li>
    <li>live audio and video</li>
    <li>heritage collections like scanned manuscripts</li>
    <li>PDFs or other documents published before 23 September 2018 - unless users need them to use a service, for example a form that lets you request school meal preferences</li>
    <li>maps but you’ll need to provide essential information, like an address, in an accessible format</li>
    <li>third party content that’s under someone else’s control if you did not pay for it or develop it yourself, for example social media ‘like’ buttons</li>
    <li>content on intranets or extranets published before 23 September 2019 - unless you make a major revision after that date</li>
    <li>archived websites if they are not needed for services your organisation provides and they are not updated</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In your accessibility statement, you need to explain that things like this are not accessible because they are exempt.</p>
