  <h2 id="understand-the-environment">Understand the environment</h2>

  <p>People working in Defence have unique needs.</p>

  <p>Consider people in the deployed space, for example military units working away from their permanent base. There are also many people in the operational space, supporting military operations and exercises.</p>

  <p>These users may have issues such as:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>low to no 3G and 4G onboard ships</li>
    <li>not being able to use 2-factor authentication</li>
    <li>wearing restrictive kit, such as thick gloves</li>
    <li>devices with limited battery power</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You also need to consider accessibility issues related to the battle environment, including:<p>

  <ul>
    <li>low light, red light or no light</li>
    <li>very noisy environments or the need for silence</li>
    <li>difficult outdoor conditions, such as wet screens</li>
    <li>high-stress and high-risk scenarios</li>
    <li>temperatures below freezing or extreme heat and sunlight</li>
    <li>extreme fatigue</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Accessibility needs can be permanent, temporary or situational. This is particularly relevant in military settings.</p>  

  <h2 id="meet-the-regulations">Meet the regulations</h2>

  <p>To meet UK government accessibility regulations, digital products and services must:<p>

  <ul>
    <li>meet level AA of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" rel="external nofollow">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1)</a> as a minimum</li>
    <li>work on the most commonly used assistive technologies, including screen magnifiers, screen readers and speech recognition tools</li>
    <li>include people with disabilities in user research</li>
    <li>have an accessibility statement that explains how accessible the service is</li>
  </ul>

    text: "Anyone creating digital products or services for Defence, including third-party suppliers, must make sure they meet accessibility regulations."
  }) }}

  <h2 id="your-role-in-accessibility">Your role in accessibility</h2>

  <p>Every role in digital design and delivery plays a part in accessibility.</p>

  <p>For example, for developers to build an accessible service the content needs to be designed to work with assistive technology.</p>

  <p>Check how you can help with accessibility:</p>

  </ul>

  <h2 id="create-an-accessibility-statement">Create an accessibility statement</h2>

  <p>Since 2018, all public sector websites and applications must include an accessibility statement. It needs to be published before your product or service goes into public beta.</p>

  <p>The statement needs to cover:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>whether your website or mobile app is ‘fully’, ‘partially’ or ‘not’ compliant with accessibility standards</li>
    <li>if it’s not fully compliant, which parts do not meet accessibility standards and why. For example, because they are exempt or it would be a disproportionate burden to fix</li>
    <li>how people can get alternatives to content that’s not accessible to them</li>
    <li>how to contact you to report accessibility problems - and a link to the website that they can use if they’re not happy with your response</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You can use this <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/model-accessibility-statement" rel="external nofollow">model accessibility statement</a>.</p>

  <p>If you can, work with a content designer to make sure your statement is written in plain English.</p>

  <h2 id="things-you-might-not-need-to-fix">Things you might not need to fix</h2>

  <p>Your team does not need to fix the following types of content because they’re exempt from the accessibility regulations:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>pre-recorded audio and video published before 23 September 2020</li>
    <li>live audio and video</li>
    <li>heritage collections like scanned manuscripts</li>
    <li>PDFs or other documents published before 23 September 2018 - unless users need them to use a service, for example a form that lets you request school meal preferences</li>
    <li>maps but you’ll need to provide essential information, like an address, in an accessible format</li>
    <li>third party content that’s under someone else’s control if you did not pay for it or develop it yourself, for example social media ‘like’ buttons</li>
    <li>content on intranets or extranets published before 23 September 2019 - unless you make a major revision after that date</li>
    <li>archived websites if they are not needed for services your organisation provides and they are not updated</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In your accessibility statement, you need to explain that things like this are not accessible because they are exempt.</p>

  <h2 id="publish-accessibility-documents">Publish accessibility documents</h2>

  <p>Any documents you include in your service, such as PDFs, must be accessible.</p>

  <p>Check the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/publishing-accessible-documents" rel="external nofollow">publishing accessible documents</a>.</p>

  <p>If you need help making your document accessible, contact the Directorate of Defence Communications.</p>
