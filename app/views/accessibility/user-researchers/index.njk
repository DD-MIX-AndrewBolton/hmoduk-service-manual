  <p>Through user research and usability testing, you can help colleagues understand the needs of people who use assistive technology.</p>

  <h2 id="research-with-a-range-of-users">Research with a range of users</h2>

  <p>You need to consider the full range of people that are likely to use your product or service. By including a wide range of people, you can better understand how the accessibility of your service impacts everybody who needs to use it.</p>

  <h2 id="usability-testing">Usability testing</h2>

  <p>Your product or service needs to work with devices such as screen readers, screen magnifiers and speech recognition software.</p>

  <p>If you can, the best way of testing this is to observe people using assistive technology to use your product or service. If this isnâ€™t possible, you can try to use your product or service with some of the assistive technologies easily available. For example, most laptops have built-in screen readers.</p>

  <p>Ask your Delivery Lead to make time for colleagues to help with usability testing.</p>
