## Accessibility in Defence

Consider people working in the deployed space, for example military units working away from their permanent base. 

There are also many people in the operational space, supporting military operations and exercises.

People working in Defence can have issues including:

- low to no 3G and 4G onboard ships
- not being able to use 2-factor authentication
- wearing restrictive kit, such as thick gloves
- devices with limited battery power

In Defence envoronments, accessibility needs can be permanent, temporary or situational. 

## Consider the battlespace

You might need to consider accessibility issues in the battle environment, including:

- low light, red light or no light
- very noisy environments or the need for silence
- difficult outdoor conditions, such as wet screens
- high-stress and high-risk scenarios
- temperatures below freezing or extreme heat and sunlight
- extreme fatigue
