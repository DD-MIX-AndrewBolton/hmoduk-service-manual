## The regulations

By law in the UK, all government digital services and products must:

- meet level AA of the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21) as a minimum
- work on the most commonly used assistive technologies, including screen magnifiers, screen readers and speech recognition tools
- include people with disabilities in user research

Some services also need an [accessibility statement](/accessibility/accessibility-statements).

### This applies to everyone

Anyone creating digital services or products for Defence, including third-party suppliers, must make sure they meet UK accessibility regulations. 

Check the guidance on [accessibility for public sector bodies](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps).

## Your role in accessibility

Everyone in a digital design and delivery team plays a part in accessibility.

For Developers to build an accessible service, the designs and content need to work with assistive technology. Delivery Managers need to include time for accessibility audits and testing new features with assistive technologies.
