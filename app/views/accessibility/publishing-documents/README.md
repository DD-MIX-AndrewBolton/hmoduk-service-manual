## Accessibility statements

Since 2018, all public sector websites and applications must include an accessibility statement. It needs to be published before your service or product goes into public beta.

The statement needs to cover:

- whether your website or mobile app is ‘fully’, ‘partially’ or ‘not’ compliant with accessibility standards
- if it’s not fully compliant, which parts do not meet accessibility standards and why. For example, because they are exempt or it would be a disproportionate burden to fix
- how people can get alternatives to content that’s not accessible to them
- how to contact you to report accessibility problems - and a link to the website that they can use if they’re not happy with your response

You can use this [model accessibility statement](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/model-accessibility-statement).

If you can, work with a content designer to make sure your statement is written in plain English.

## Things you might not need to fix

You do not need to make these things accessible: 

- pre-recorded audio and video published before 23 September 2020
- live audio and video
- heritage collections like scanned manuscripts
- PDFs or other documents published before 23 September 2018 - unless users need them to use a service, for example a form that lets you request school meal preferences
- maps but you’ll need to provide essential information, like an address, in an accessible format
- third party content that’s under someone else’s control if you did not pay for it or develop it yourself, for example social media ‘like’ buttons
- content on intranets or extranets published before 23 September 2019 - unless you make a major revision after that date
- archived websites if they are not needed for services your organisation provides and they are not updated

In your accessibility statement, you need to explain that things like this are not accessible because they are exempt.

## Publish accessible documents

Any documents you include in your service, such as PDFs, must be accessible.

Check the guidance on [publishing accessible documents](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/publishing-accessible-documents).

If you need help making your document accessible, contact the Directorate of Defence Communications.
