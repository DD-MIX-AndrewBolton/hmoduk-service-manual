  <p>Depending on their rank and duties, some staff will require approval from their commanding officer to participate in user research activities.</p>

  <p>You should consider that it may take longer to recruit service personnel for research and plan sessions in good time.</p>

  <p>If you hold a focus group or workshop with military users of different ranks, consider the impact of the chain of command on what users decide they can or cannot contribute.</p>

  <p>The military are naturally rank-conscious and may adapt their behaviour. For example, a participant may moderate their answers to questions in a research interview if someone more senior is in the room.</p>

  <h2 id="how-to-address-service-personnel">How to address service personnel</h2>

  <p>If you are a civilian, you are not required to address officers with Sir, Maâ€™am or their military title. However, it is polite to ask at the beginning of your session how they prefer to be addressed.</p>
