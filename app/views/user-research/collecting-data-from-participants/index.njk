We must collect data in a legal and transparent way. Clearly explain to participants what we will use data for and that we will use it for no other purpose.

## Meet the regulations

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect in May 2018. When doing user research at MOD, the important things to note are:

- it defines personal data broadly, so that it can include data like online identification markers and location data
- rules around evidence of informed consent and withdrawal of consent are strict
- it sets out stronger requirements for documenting and auditing your practices

The [Ministry of Defence Privacy Notice](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ministry-of-defence-privacy-notice/mod-privacy-notice) explains the sort of information you can collect from users and why.

To make sure your data management and privacy practices meet the regulations, get them reviewed by a data protection adviser. The Ministry of Defence (MOD) has a network of advisers.

## Get informed consent

Whenever you do user research, you must get the participant’s informed consent. This means getting a record from them to show they understand your research and agree to take part.

### Why you need it

By getting informed consent, you’ll help make sure that:

- participants understand what they’re signing up to, making your sessions more effective
- your research is ethical
- you comply with data protection law

### How to get it

#### What to tell participants

You must tell participants:

- if you will be recording any audio or video portions of the research sessions
- who any recording will be shared with
- if anyone will be taking notes during the session
- who any notes will be shared with
- how long you plan to keep the session data and information

You must then ask the participant if they:

- understand the main purpose of the research session
- are happy to be contacted again for further research
- have any questions about the session

#### Get them to complete a consent form

Share a [MOD consent form](#0) with your participants and ask them to complete it. You need to add details about your research.

#### Give them an information sheet

You should also share an information sheet to give the participant more information about the research.

Your information sheet should give details about:

- the types of questions you will ask
- the digital service you are testing or discussing
- the technology you plan to use for the research session
- the discussion topics you will cover during the research session
- how any usability testing will be carried out, for example in a lab or using online collaboration software
- the classification of the research and what this means, especially if SECRET or above
- how the user can withdraw from the current or future research

You can use this example of a [MOD understanding your participation sheet](#0).

## Protect sensitive data

{{ govukInsetText({
  text: "Do not reveal any sensitive data about an individual when carrying out user research."
}) }}

Sensitive data is any information that could cause the participant embarrassment or distress and which they can reasonably expect to remain private. This includes:

- age
- marital status
- racial or ethnic origin
- nationality
- physical or mental health or condition, including disability status
- sexual life
- biometrics and genetics
- photographs, videos or sound recordings in which individuals can be identified
- any data collected where a guarantee of confidentiality was given

Sensitive data also covers things like:

- political opinions
- religious or similar beliefs
- benefit claims history or entitlement
- membership of trade unions
- commission or alleged commission of an offence
- cause of death, where this is not a matter of public record

### Surveys and questionnaires

Check that you are only collecting the data that you need to answer your research questions.

Unless it is essential to your research, consider not collecting information on protected characteristics, including:

- gender
- age
- disability status
- sexuality
- education background
- ethnicity
- nationality
- marital status
- caring responsibilities

### Non-sensitive data

Some personal data items are not considered sensitive when captured on their own. These include a participant’s:

- sex
- rank or grade
- full-time or part-time working status
