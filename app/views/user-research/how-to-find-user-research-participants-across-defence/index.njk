  <h2 id="recruit-internal-participants">Recruit internal participants</h2>

  <p>Use staff directories to find colleagues in the Ministry of Defence (MOD).</p>

  <p>For longer research campaigns, you should engage through the existing Chain of Command (CoC) and tasking processes.</p>

  <p>If you cannot find a specific group to research with, you can speak to Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and supporting military personnel to help you with recruitment.</p>

  <h3>Large scale testing</h3>

  <p>There may be existing processes in place for large scale testing activity. Check with your Front Line Command (FLC) to see what is available.</p>

  <h2 id="recruit-users-across-defence">Recruit users across Defence</h2>

  <p>If you have access to MODNET, you can often find staff names and details on your Command Sharepoint. If you do not have access to this or other platforms, ask a permanent staff member to help you.</p>

  {{ govukInsetText({
    text: "Do not use social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn or TikTok to recruit participants for user research."
  }) }}

  <h3>Army participants</h3>

  <p>To find research participants in the Army, use the <a href="https://www.army.mod.uk/deployments/army-knowledge-exchange" rel="external nofollow">Army Knowledge Exchange (AKX)</a>.</p>

  <h3>Participants with no MODNET access<h3>

  <p>To find users with little or no access to MODNET, use <a href="https://www.army.mod.uk/digital-communications/defence-connect-guidance" rel="external nofollow">Defence Connect</a>. You can also use the platform to carry out randomised surveys and questionnaires.</p>

  <h3>Anonymous research</h3>

  <p>You can start a discussion or set up a questionnaire on <a href="https://trustedvoices.explainonline.co.uk/login" rel="external nofollow">Trusted Voices</a>. MOD staff use aliases on the platform to discuss sensitive topics like pay, mental health and bullying.</p>

  <h2 id="research-with-disabled-users">Research with disabled users</h2>

  <p>You must include people with different disabilities in your research. This helps your service meet the needs of all of its users.</p>

  <p>You need to include participants who:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>are disabled or use assistive technologies</li>
    <li>have limited digital skills or low literacy</li>
    <li>may need help to use your service</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The Defence Disability Network (DDN) can help you recruit participants with condition-specific disabilities.</p>
