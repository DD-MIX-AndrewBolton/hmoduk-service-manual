<div class="mod-prose">

  <p>Always anonymise personal identifiable data when storing your research records. This includes things like a personâ€™s name or address. Refer to the participant by code instead.</p>

  <p>If needed, create a separate document which matches the codes to the personal identifiable data. The document must be password protected and only shared with colleagues if necessary.</p>

  <p>You should retain this information for no longer than 2 years.</p>

  <h2 id="video-recordings-and-transcripts">Video recordings and transcripts</h2>

  <p>Anonymising video recordings is time consuming and can be ineffective. Consider whether you really need to store a video or screen recording of a user before your session.</p>
