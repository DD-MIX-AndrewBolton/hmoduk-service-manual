It is important to work in the open when possible. Check what this means in Defence, including what you can and cannot publish online.

## Working in the open in Defence

To meet the GOV.UK Service Standard, work in the open when you can and when there is a need. In Defence, you must always consider what is safe to share openly. 

For example, we only include OFFICIAL information in this manual. It is published online so that everyone across Defence and other government departments can use it. 

Anyone can find useful OFFICIAL [information about Defence on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-defence).

You should never find information about Defence online that puts people, plans or projects at risk. 

 ## Keep information secure and people safe 

There are individuals and groups around the world looking to find and exploit information about Defence. If you publish the smallest piece of sensitive information online, you could put military personnel and citizens at risk.

Sometimes OFFICIAL information includes details that are too sensitive to publish. 

For example, OFFICIAL information can include personal details that could identify military personnel and their families. 

OFFICIAL information can also include commercially sensitive details like price negotiations and system vulnerabilities. 

This kind of information is usually, but not always, labelled as OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE.

Find out [more about labelling information](/security-classifications/how-to-label-information/).

## What you must not publish online

Do not publish sensitive, SECRET or TOP-SECRET information online. 

Anything you publish online, must not include: 

- any personal details, including named email addresses 
- specific details of software or tools used in Defence
- details of Defence Slack workspaces and channels 

If you need to publish an email address for users to contact you, create a general email address like contact@ or support@. 

Sometimes, you need to tell users to use tools like GitHub or AWS. Do not publish specific details online, like account names or links to Defence accounts.
