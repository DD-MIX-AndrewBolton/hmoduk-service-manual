If your service has words, images or videos, you should have a content designer on your team. 

## When to get a content designer

Writing clear, useful content starts with understanding what users are trying to do. 

Usually, a content designer works closely with a user researcher and an interaction designer from the start of a project. 

In Alpha, Beta and Live, a content designer creates content that is simple, easy to understand and follows GOV.UK style.

If your team does not have a content designer, ask the UCD community for advice. 

## Plan to pair write 

Content often needs input from experts, for example in policy or security. 

Many content designers set up sessions to create content with experts. This is known as pair writing.

Tips for pair writing include:

- working with no more than 2 experts
- use a collaborative tool like Google Docs
- put the user needs at the top of the document
- only write what users need to know

Pair writing helps experts understand content design and is faster than tracking changes by email.

## Use the content design community 

If you need to create content but your team does not yet have a content designer, ask for advice on the MOD content community Slack channel. 

On a MODNET device, you can use Slack in your web browser.
