If your service has words, images or videos, you should have a content designer on your team. 

## When to get a content designer

Writing clear, useful content starts with understanding what users are trying to do. In discovery, a content designer works closely with a user researcher and an interaction designer. 

In alpha, beta and live, a content designer creates content that:

- meets user needs
- is simple and easy to understand 
- follows GOV.UK style

If your team does not have a content designer, [ask the content community for advice](/your-community/content/). 

## Pair write with experts

Content often needs input from experts, for example in policy or security. 

Many content designers work with experts to write content. They share a document and set up a call or meeting to work on content together. This is known as pair writing. 

Tips for pair writing include:

- work with no more than 2 experts
- use a tool like Google Docs
- put the user needs at the top of the document
- only write what users need to know

Pair writing is faster than tracking changes by email and makes version control easier. It also helps experts understand the importance of user-centred content.

## Use the content community 

If you need to create content but your team does not yet have a content designer, [ask the content community for advice](/your-community/content/). 

You can also share content that you are working on with the content community.
