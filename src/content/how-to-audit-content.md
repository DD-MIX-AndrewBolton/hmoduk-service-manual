Teams publishing content in Defence are expected to check that content is still correct and needed. The best way to check is by doing regular content audits.

## Why you need to audit content

Defence publishes a lot of content in many different places. Too much content makes it harder for people to find the information they need. Content that is no longer correct is confusing and can be dangerous.

By doing regular audits, you:

- improve the quality of content
- deliver better search results
- make it easier and cheaper to manage content

## Where to start 

If your team has never done a content audit, run a workshop to share how we do it in Defence. You need to include people who: 

- create the content
- own the content
- manage the service or platform
- are subject matter experts

You can [use the content audit slides]() created by Content and Transaction Services (CTS), [part of Defence Digital Foundry].
