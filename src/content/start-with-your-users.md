You can only create useful content if you understand your users and what they need to do.

## Get to know your users

Before writing content for services in Defence, you need to understand: 

- who your users are
- what tasks they are trying to do
- how they will use your content 

For example, medical personnel use an app on different devices to track casualties across a battlefield. The content must be correct and easy to understand in a highly stressful environment.
 
## Only tell users what they need to know

If you write content that is not needed, you make it harder for users to do a task. It also costs time and money. 

You need to:

1. Write the minimum amount of content users need to do the task.
2. Test the content with actual or potential users.

This helps you:

- keep content specific to the task
- check if users understand content
- get evidence of what content is missing

## Work with a user researcher

When you have written content, it can be hard to present it without bias.

Ask a user researcher to test your content with users. They are familiar with research processes and ethics in Defence. Make sure you observe the research sessions.

If your team does not have a user researcher, [ask the UCD community for advice](https://servicemanual.digital.mod.uk/your-community/user-centred-design/).
