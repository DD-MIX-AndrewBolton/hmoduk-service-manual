            <p class="govuk-body">When you buy or build a tool, think about it as a service rather than an application.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">Thinking of applications as services, helps you:</p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>define what people need to do</li>
            <li>find more users who can use the tool</li>
            <li>reduce the number of tools that do the same thing</li>

            <p class="govuk-body">Understanding your userâ€™s needs helps you define the requirements for a tool. You will also make better decisions for Defence.</p>

            <li>have fewer tools that do the same thing</li>
            <li>reduce energy consumption and costs</li>
