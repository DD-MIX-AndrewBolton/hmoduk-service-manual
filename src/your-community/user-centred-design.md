Anyone working on digital products or services in Defence is welcome to join the user-centred design (UCD) community. It is useful for:

- user researchers and data analysts
- service designers and product designers
- interaction and graphic designers
- content designers, managers and strategists
- product managers and business analysts working with users

## Get involved

There are a few easy ways to be part of the UCD community.

### Community calls

Join the UCD community calls held every 2 weeks on alternate Tuesdays and Thursdays.

Calls are 45 minutes. We discuss things like accessibility, tools available in Defence and cross-government collaboration.

}) }}

We work under [the Chatham House Rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/chatham-house-rule?gclid=CjwKCAjwkYGVBhArEiwA4sZLuK5u_XCJRH7ClZyiXlhtQLMleAKX6CZ3Ka8cuQ1hr70AfK95tVehOhoCP5wQAvD_BwE), creating a safe space for you to share your work and any challenges.

To join, send an email to: [ucd@digital.mod.uk](mailto:ucd@digital.mod.uk).

### Slack workspaces and channels
