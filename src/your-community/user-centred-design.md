Anyone working on digital services in Defence can join the user-centred design (UCD) community. 

## Who you will meet

In this community, you will meet:

- user researchers and data analysts
- service designers and product designers
- interaction and graphic designers
- content designers, managers and strategists
- product managers and business analysts working with users

## Community calls

Join the UCD community calls held every 2 weeks on alternate Wednesdays and Thursdays.

Calls are 55 minutes. We discuss things like accessibility, tools available in Defence and cross-government collaboration.

### Ask for an invitation

Using your Ministry of Defence email, send a message to: [UKStratCom-DD-Foundry-UCD-UX@mod.gov.uk](mailto:UKStratCom-DD-Foundry-UCD-UX@mod.gov.uk?subject=Join%20UCD%20community%20calls). 

Include your full name, your role and the project youâ€™re working on.

### Get feedback

You can join community calls and ask for feedback on your service. For example, you have a new feature and you are not sure which GOV.UK or Defence design patterns you should use. 

Check [how to ask for and give feedback](/your-community/ask-for-and-give-feedback).
