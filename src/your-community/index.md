# Your community

There are communities of practice for people working in similar roles across Defence.

Joining a community helps you:

- learn from what other projects are doing
- be confident that you are meeting service standards
- use common approaches and shared tools

## Communities of practice

You can join more than one community.

- [Product and delivery](/your-community/product-and-delivery/)
- [User-centred design](/your-community/user-centred-design/)

The user-centred design community includes content designers, interaction designers, service designers and user researchers.
