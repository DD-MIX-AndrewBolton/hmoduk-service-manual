There are communities of practice for people working in similar roles across Defence.

## Why join a community

Joining a community helps you:

- learn from what other projects are doing
- be confident that you are meeting service standards
- use common approaches and shared tools

## Join communities in Defence

Anyone working in Defence can join a community of practice. 

You can join more than one community.

- [Product and delivery](/your-community/product-and-delivery/)
- [Software development](/your-community/software-development/)
- [User-centred design](/your-community/user-centred-design/)

The user-centred design community includes content designers, interaction designers, service designers and user researchers.

## Become a service assessor

Some services have assessments to help them meet the GOV.UK Service Standard. Service assessors are from communities across Defence.

Training to be a service assessor will help you: 

- understand the service standards
- learn from what other services are doing
- create great digital services

Youâ€™ll also join the assessor community across government. 

### Who can get training

To get assessor training, you need to be a crown servant who has been in a specialised digital role for at least 6 months. 

If you meet these criteria, send your details to [assessments@digital.mod.uk](mailto:assessments@digital.mod.uk?subject=Service%20assessor%20training). 

We would also like to hear from all trained assessors across Defence.
