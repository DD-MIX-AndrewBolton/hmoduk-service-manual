# Take part in user research

When you sign up to be part of user research, we might ask you to:

- complete short surveys about your experiences

We anonymise all feedback. You can stop taking part at any time. 

## Send us your details

To sign up to user research, send us your:

- full name, including rank if relevant
- job title and organisation

You can include a short description of what you are working on.
