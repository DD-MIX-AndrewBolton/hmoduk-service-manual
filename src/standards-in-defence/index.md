All teams creating digital services for Defence should meet GOV.UK service standards. This applies to internal services as well as services for citizens. 

Meeting the GOV.UK service standards helps you:

- design the right thing for your users
- reuse existing patterns and capabilities
- make the best recruitment and technology choices

## 1. Understand users and their needs

You should test your service with real users in the place that they use it. In Defence, this is not always possible. Consider testing in a simulated environment or bringing a representative user into your design team. 

Be aware that your users might not be contactable for long periods while they are on deployment.

## 2. Solve a whole problem for users

Before you design a new service, check existing capabilities in Defence that can be reused for part or all of your user’s journey.

Consider environmental and physical constraints that exist across Defence. For example, some military personnel have periods with little or no wifi.

## 3. Provide a joined up experience across all channels

Identify all of the platforms and places where your service will be used. It could be across land, sea and air, on military bases or in the battlespace. You might also need to integrate with systems used by our allies. 

Check how to classify information and manage it securely across all channels.

## 4. Make the service simple to use

Defence environments can be complex but users need services that are quick, simple and easy to use.  

In the UK, every government digital service for citizens or internal users must be accessible. Consider Defence accessibility needs that are permanent, temporary or situational.

## 5. Make sure everyone can use the service

People in Defence can face physical barriers to using digital services. For example: they might have no wifi, low lighting or need to wear thick gloves. They can also find themselves dealing with extreme weather, stressful situations and fatigue.

## 6. Have a multidisciplinary team

If you’re creating services for military personnel, make sure some of the people on your team have military or Defence experience. If this is not possible, work closely with military users and stakeholders. 

Consider the level of security clearance each person on your team needs. 
Plan ahead -  it can take longer than usual for new people to join.

## 7. Use agile ways of working
	
In Defence, new technology poses a threat and an opportunity. Digital teams need to move quickly. Use agile ways of working to turn ideas and the latest technology into great services for Defence.

## 8. Iterate and improve frequently

Some digital services in Defence are dependant on legacy systems that do not use agile delivery methods. If this is the case, iterate and improve what you can within the scope of your service.
	
You might need to plan the release of improvements around maintenance schedules or when military personnel are deployed.

## 9. Create a secure service which protects users’ privacy

Evaluate and classify all information your service collects, stores and provides. Do not classify information higher than it needs to be.

Identify and address security threats, privacy issues and risks associated with your service. Ask for advice from others in Defence.

## 10. Define what success looks like and publish performance data

As well as measuring how your service is used, you might need to measure operational effectiveness. This can include readiness to deploy a battalion or time saved to do a task.

For some services in Defence, it might not be appropriate to share performance data publicly. 

[More on this standard on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/point-10-define-success-publish-performance-data)


## 11. Choose the right tools and technology

To deploy your service successfully, you might need to integrate with legacy platforms across Defence. They could be on land, on the sea, under the water or in the air. Understand any technical and physical constraints before you start. 

Consider reusing technology already available in Defence. You also need to check which tools are suitable for use in Defence.

[More on this standard on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/point-11-choose-the-right-tools-and-technology)


## 12. Make new source code open

Before you use open source code, check that it is appropriate for use in Defence. You can ask other teams, in your community of practice and in the [support channel on Defence Digital Slack](https://defencedigital.slack.com/archives/C02GUNVHBBL). 

If you use open source code and would like to contribute to it, you must not share any sensitive, SECRET or TOP SECRET information.

[More on this standard on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/point-12-make-new-source-code-open)


## 13. Use and contribute to open standards, common components and patterns

It is important to share the good things you are doing with other Government Departments in the UK and our allies internationally. You must not openly share any sensitive, SECRET or TOP SECRET information. 

In Defence, use show and tells and community meet-ups to share what you are doing with other teams. You can also contribute to the MOD Frontend library.

## 14. Operate a reliable service

Across Defence, all users should have digital services that are reliable. In some circumstances, a service not being available when it is needed can put lives at risk. 

Identify potential risks and security threats to the reliability of your service. Create clear instructions on how to respond and share them with the team.
