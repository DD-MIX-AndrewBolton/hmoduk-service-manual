You no longer apply for security accreditation that lasts for a period of time. You need to show that your project is Secure by Design. 

This includes projects delivered by suppliers.  

## Show your project is secure

You need to design security into projects from the start. You need to continually assess and manage security risks until your technology or service is retired. 

Your team needs to show that you are doing Secure by Design activities, including:

- agreeing roles and responsibilities
- deciding how much risk is acceptable
- continually reviewing your security

{{ component('inset-text', {
  text: 'If your project has existing security accreditation, you need to move to Secure by Design when it expires. Start preparing for it now.'
}) }}

## What you need to do

Check the activities you need to do and the tools you can use. Follow the guidance in each phase: 
 
- [get started]()
- [manage your risks]()
- [stay secure]() 

When you can, reuse existing frameworks and tools. For example, you need to use the Cyber Activity and Assurance Tracker (CAAT) to submit regular self assessments.

##  Ask for an assessment

<p class="govuk-body" style="color:red">
Check with CySAAS that this is factually correct.
</p> 

You can ask for an independent review of your Secure by Design activities. 

The Cyber Security Assurance and Advisory Service (CySAAS) can check how you are doing at major milestones, for example: 

- before an investment appraisal 
- after major design changes
- ...

CySAAS looks at self-assessment reports submitted by projects. If your project is considered high risk, you might be selected for an assessment.  

You can [find out more about CySAAS]().
