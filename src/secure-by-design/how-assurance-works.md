Your team is responsible for managing cyber security risks in your technology or service. You do not apply for security accreditation that lasts for a period of time. 

## Assess your security

To be Secure by Design, you need to keep checking that your technology or service is secure. You need to do regular assessments. Most projects in Defence do a security assessment every 3 months. 

When you do your assessments, use the Cyber Activity and Assurance Tracker (CAAT). It helps you meet Secure by Design standards in Defence. It also sends a report to the Cyber Security Assurance and Advisory Service (CySAAS).

Find out [more about self-assessments and CAAT](). 


### Independent assessments

The Cyber Security Assurance and Advisory Service (CySAAS) looks at self-assessment reports submitted by projects. If your project is considered high risk, you might be selected for an assessment.  

CySAAS can check how you are doing at major milestones, for example before an investment appraisal. Check [how to ask for an assessment]().


## Give regular updates

You need to give stakeholders confidence that you are keeping your technology or service secure. 

Make security part of your existing governance and meetings. For example, add a security update to the agenda for your project boards. You will also need to create and maintain a risk register. 

Anyone on your team can report on security but your Senior Responsible Owner (SRO) is accountable. Check [who can be an SRO]().

## Follow the guidance

Check the activities you need to do and the tools you can use. Follow the Secure by Design guidance in each phase: 
 
- [get started]()
- [manage your risks]()
- [stay secure]()
