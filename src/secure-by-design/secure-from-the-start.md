You need to design security into projects from the start. 

Then, you need to continually assess and manage security risks until your technology or service is retired.  

## Across government

The Cabinet Office expects all UK government departments and arms-length bodies to follow a Secure by Design approach. 

Following a Secure by Design approach, you will: 

- help create resilient technology and services
- make security everyone’s responsibility
- improve trust and data sharing

## In the Ministry of Defence

Every technology and service that handles Defence data needs to be Secure by Design. 
 
The cyber landscape is constantly evolving. If you do not design technology and services with cyber security in mind it can lead to serious consequences, including loss of life. 

To keep our people and data safe, we need to constantly identify and address cyber security risks. Following a Secure by Design approach, you help Defence stay ahead of adversaries and maintain national security.
