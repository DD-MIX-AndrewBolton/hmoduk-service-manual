You need to design security into projects from the start. 

Then, you need to continually assess and manage security risks until your technology or service is retired.  

## Across government

Cabinet Office policy is that all government departments and arm's length bodies must be Secure by Design. 

Following a Secure by Design approach, departments will: 

- help create resilient technology and services
- make security everyone’s responsibility
- improve trust and data sharing

## In the Ministry of Defence

The Ministry of Defence is implementing Secure by Design in all top level budgets and arm’s length bodies.
 
You no longer have to apply for security accreditation that lasts for a period of time. You must follow a Secure by Design approach.

You need to show that your team:
- has considered cyber security from the start
- has chosen appropriate security frameworks and controls
- is continuously managing risks

}) }}
