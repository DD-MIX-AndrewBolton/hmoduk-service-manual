Every technology and service that handles Defence data needs to be Secure by Design. 

## Projects this applies to

Since July 2023, new technology infrastructure and digital services in Defence need to follow the Secure by Design approach. This includes projects delivered by suppliers.

Examples include: 

- networks
- applications
- services
- platforms
- weapons systems

}) }}


### Be secure in all phases

To be Secure by Design, you continuously identify and manage security risks. You need to do this across the full life cycle of your project. This includes: 

- definition
- acquisition
- design 
- development
- maintenance
- disposal


## Who is responsible

Your team is responsible for implementing and running Secure by Design.

You need to appoint a Senior Responsible Officer (SRO) to be accountable for Secure by Design. 

Your SRO needs to be someone with authority and experience in risk management, for example a product or service owner. If you do not have someone suitable, your project sponsor can be your SRO.

SROs are usually supported by security and delivery leads. If you do not have anyone on your team with security experience, you need to fill that role. 


## Get your team involved

Secure by Design encourages everyone to identify and manage risk. Make sure your team understands:

- the project is responsible for cyber security
- why designing security in from the start is important
- their role in keeping MOD data secure
