You need to design security into projects from the start. 

Then, you need to continually assess and manage security risks until your technology or service is retired.  

## A government approach

The Cabinet Office expects all UK government departments and arms-length bodies to follow a Secure by Design approach. 

Following a Secure by Design approach, you will: 

- use effective security practices 
- help create resilient technology and services
- make security everyoneâ€™s responsibility
- improve trust and data sharing

## Secure by Design in Defence

The cyber landscape is constantly evolving. If you do not design technology and services with cyber security in mind it can lead to serious consequences, including loss of life.

To keep our people and data safe, you need to change the way you identify and manage security risks. Following a Secure by Design approach, you help Defence stay ahead of adversaries and maintain national security.

To be Secure by Design, you need to show that your team:

- has considered cyber security from the start
- uses appropriate security frameworks and controls
- is continuously managing risks

## What you need to do

To be Secure by Design, you and your team need to do certain activities. These are grouped into 7 areas: 

**1. Set your context**

Define how your technology or service uses Defence data and how much risk it carries.

**2. Plan security activities**

Manage stakeholders, agree a suitable way to assess risk and select a control framework.

**3. Manage security risks**

Continuously manage risk and use existing tools for regular self assessments.

**4. Set your controls**

Use existing tools to design and implement ways to address security risks.

**5. Work with suppliers**

Identify security risks when buying products and services and address them in contracts.

**6. Check your approach**

Test that your activities and controls are working and correct any vulnerabilities.

**7. Stay secure**

Keep assessing security risks against functional changes and external threats.
