            <h2 id="check-your-team-has-security-skills">Check your team has security skills</h2>

            <p>You need people in your team with cyber security experience appropriate for your project. </p>

            <p>For example [add an example here]. </p>

            <p>You might need support from outside your team. [How do teams go about doing this?].</p>


            <h3>Appoint an owner</h3>

            <p>If you do not have a Senior Responsible Officer (SRO), someone in your team needs to take on the role. For example, your product or service owner.</p>
            
            <p>Your SRO needs to have authority and experience in risk management. Your SRO is accountable for the overall security of your technology or service. They need to have authority and experience in risk management. If you do not have someone suitable, your project sponsor can be your SRO. </p>
            
            <p>If you do not have someone suitable, your project sponsor can be your SRO.</p>
         
            <h3>Agree who does what</h3>

            <p>Decide who is responsible and accountable for Secure by Design activities.</p>
            
            <p>For example, a developer is responsible for [xxx xx xxx xxx]. Your delivery lead is accountable, they need to make sure it happens.</p>

            <p>Your SRO is accountable for the overall security of your technology or service.</p>
