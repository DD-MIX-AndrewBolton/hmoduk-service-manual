        <p class="govuk-body">All technology and services that handle Defence data must be Secure by Design. This includes projects delivered by suppliers.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Designing security into projects from the start helps Defence stay ahead of adversaries and maintain national security.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What has changed</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">Cabinet Office policy is that all government departments and arm’s length bodies must be Secure by Design.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">The Ministry of Defence (MOD) is implementing Secure by Design in all top level budgets and arm’s length bodies.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">You no longer have to apply for security accreditation that lasts for a period of time.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">To be Secure by Design, your team needs to:</p>
       
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>consider cyber security from the start</li>
            <li>choose appropriate security frameworks and controls</li>
            <li>continuously manage risks</li>
        </ul>

{{ component('inset-text', {
  text: 'If your project has existing security accreditation, you need to move to Secure by Design when it expires. Start preparing for it now.'
}) }}
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="What you need to do">Get your team involved</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">Secure by Design encourages everyone to identify and manage risk. Make sure your team understands:</p> 

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>that the project is responsible for cyber security</li>
            <li>why designing for security from the start is important</li>
            <li>their role in keeping MOD data secure</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">The project team is responsible for cyber security but you also need to nominate a Senior Responsible Owner (SRO). They will be accountable for Secure by Design.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Your SRO needs to be someone with authority who has experience in risk management.</p>
        
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Check what you need to do</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">To be Secure by Design, your team needs to do certain activities. These include:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>agreeing roles and responsibilities</li>
            <li>deciding how much risk is acceptable</li>
            <li>continually reviewing your security</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">To check what you need to do, <a href="https://mod.defencegateway.mod.uk/securebydesign/SitePages/Welcome_to_Secure_By_Design.aspx" target="_blank">sign in to the Secure by Design portal<span class="govuk-visually-hidden">opens in a new tab</span></a>.</p>  

        <p class="govuk-body">To access the Secure by Design portal, you must work in Defence or for one of our suppliers. If you do not have access, ask a senior military or MOD civil servant on your team to arrange it for you.</p>
