            <p>Check you have the people and processes in place to be Secure by Design.</p>

            <h2 id="involve-the-right-people">Involve the right people</h2>

            <p>Your team is responsible for making and keeping your technology or service secure. You need people with cyber security experience that is appropriate to your project.</p>
            
            <p>For example [add an example here].</p>

            <p>You might need to use resources from outside your team. [How do teams go about doing this?].</p>
         
            <h3>Agree who does what</h3>

            <p>You need to agree who is responsible and accountable for Secure by Design activities.</p>
            
            <p>For example, a developer is responsible for [xxx xx xxx xxx]. Your delivery lead is accountable for making sure it happens. </p>

            <p>Check <a href="https://www.security.gov.uk/guidance/secure-by-design/activities/agreeing-roles-and-responsibilities" target="_blank">GOV.UK guidance on roles and responsibilities<span class="govuk-visually-hidden"> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>.</p>
            
            <p>The GOV.UK guidance includes a template you can use.</p>

            <h3>Appoint a Senior Responsible Owner</h3>

            <p>If you do not have a Senior Responsible Officer (SRO), someone in your team needs to take on the role. </p>
            
            <p>Your SRO needs to be someone with authority and experience in risk management, for example a product or service owner. If you do not have someone suitable, your project sponsor can be your SRO.</p>

             <h2 id="agree-your-strategy">Agree your strategy</h2>

            <p>To help you plan your approach to Secure by Design, create a cyber risk management strategy.</p>

            <p>Your strategy should include:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>how much risk is acceptable for your technology or service</li>
              <li>managing cyber security risks throughout the life of the project</li>
              <li>adding cyber security to existing governance</li>
              <li>considerations for stakeholders, including suppliers </li>
              <li>how you will monitor and share cyber security threats</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Set your risk appetite</h3>

            <p>You need to define and publish how much risk is acceptable to your technology or service. For example [add an example here, possibly about personal data].</p>
            <p>Many top level budgets have risk appetite statements. Check the risk appetite statement for your organisation. Your project's risk appetite will need to follow it.</p>
            
            {{ component('inset-text', {
            text: 'You must review your risk appetite when you make major changes or new threats are reported.'
            }) }}

            </ul>

            <h3>Set your risk appetite</h3>

            <p>Share your strategy with internal and authorised stakeholders, including programme boards and suppliers.</p>
            
            <p>Classify your strategy correctly, for example [security classification]. </p>

            <h2 id="plan-to-continually-manage-risk">Plan to continually manage risk</h2>

            <p>You need to think about how you will manage cyber risk throughout the life of your project. This includes:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>in design and development</li>
              <li>when major changes are released</li>
              <li>retiring components securely</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What you need to do</h3>

            <p>Make cyber security part of your existing activities and meetings. For example, you need to:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>put cyber security on the agenda for all programme board meetings</li>
              <li>publish your progress towards security milestones</li>
              <li>share what you are doing in show and tells</li>
              <li>keep your Senior Responsible Officer (SRO) updated</li>
            </ul>

          <ul class="govuk-list">
