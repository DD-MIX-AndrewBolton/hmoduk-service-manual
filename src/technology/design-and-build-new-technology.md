When you design and build new technology for Defence, you need to do it the right way. Check the principles you need to follow.

## Defence Technology Principles

### 1. Use common standards and patterns
To avoid duplication and unnecessary costs, build your solution using approved technology, data and services.

### 2. Integrate and adapt
When designing a solution, you need to plan integrations with current and future Defence data and systems.

### 3. Make data easy to access
Data should be available to users and systems when and where they need it, on appropriate devices and infrastructure.

### 4. Make your technical solution secure
Follow Secure by Design and other approaches to keep technology secure throughout its lifetime.

### 5. Future proof from the start
You need to make sure Defence technology remains current, supported, secure and reliable.

### 6. Use the cloud first
Host services in the cloud - it is the preferred approach across government. 

### 7. Automate and innovate where you can
When appropriate, use modern technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Robotic Process Automation (RPA).

### 8. Reuse when you can
Across Defence, you need to share and reuse existing solutions to save time and money.

### 9. Continually improve
The best way to build good, user-centred products is to start small and iterate often.

## Apply the principles in Defence

For guidance on how to apply these principles in Defence, you need access to a MOD device.

On a MOD device, you can [find out more about the Defence Technology Principles](https://defence-technology-principles.digital.mod.uk/).

You should also check you are following the [GOV.UK Technology Code of Practice](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-technology-code-of-practice). It is an agreed standard used across UK Government.
