You need to mark information correctly so that people understand how to protect and share it.

{{ modukcomponent('do-dont-list', {
  'title': 'Do',
  'type': 'tick',
  'items': [
    {
      'item': 'Write security classifications in all capitals'
    },
    {
      'item': 'Clearly mark OFFICIAL, SECRET and TOP SECRET information'
    }
  ]
}) }}

{{ modukcomponent('do-dont-list', {
  'title': 'Donâ€™t',
  'type': 'cross',
  'items': [
    {
      'item': 'classify information higher than it needs'
    },
    {
      'item': 'use OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE as a security classification'
    }
  ]
}) }}

## OFFICIAL information

Where possible, you need to mark information as OFFICIAL. If the information can be printed out, add the marking to the header and footer. 
  
### Do not over classify OFFICIAL information

If you classify information higher than it needs, people may struggle to access it. For example, services classified as SECRET do not let users access the internet.

Managing SECRET information is at least 10 times more expensive than OFFICIAL information.

### Use OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE correctly

OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE is not a security classification. It is an additional marking used to identify sensitive information stored on OFFICIAL systems.

Using OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE as a security classification can lead to dangerous practices including:

- all data being treated as equally sensitive
- designing systems to protect all types of sensitive data when they only handle some sensitive data or none at all


## OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE, SECRET and TOP SECRET information

You must clearly mark OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE, SECRET and TOP SECRET information.

If the information can be printed out, add the marking to the header and footer. You also need to add the marking in the subject line of emails.

### Add more details about the information

In most cases, you need to provide more details on how OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE, SECRET and TOP-SECRET information should be handled. 

Add the details to the classification marking like this:

CLASSIFICATION - HANDLING INSTRUCTION 

### Check the official list

There are many official handling instructions and descriptors. 

Examples include:

- RECIPIENTS ONLY for information that must be handled by named individuals on a strict need-to-know basis
- LOCSEN for information that staff engaged overseas cannot access
- PERSONAL for sensitive information that can be linked to an individual

There are also codewords, prefixes and national caveats.
