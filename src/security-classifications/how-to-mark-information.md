You need to mark information correctly so that people understand how to protect and share it.

{{ modukcomponent('do-dont-list', {
  'title': 'Do',
  'type': 'tick',
  'items': [
    {
      'item': 'Write security classifications in all capitals'
    },
    {
      'item': 'Clearly mark OFFICIAL, SECRET and TOP SECRET information'
    }
  ]
}) }}

{{ modukcomponent('do-dont-list', {
  'title': 'Donâ€™t',
  'type': 'cross',
  'items': [
    {
      'item': 'classify information higher than it needs'
    },
    {
      'item': 'use OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE as a security classification'
    }
  ]
}) }}

## OFFICIAL information

Where possible, you need to mark information as OFFICIAL. 

If the information can be printed out, add the marking to the header and footer. You should also add the marking in the subject line of emails.

### Use OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE correctly

OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE is not a security classification. It is an additional marking. 

Only use OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE if there are sensitive details in OFFICIAL information.


## SECRET and TOP SECRET information

You must clearly mark SECRET and TOP SECRET information.

If the information can be printed out, add the marking to the header and footer. You must also add the marking in the subject line of emails.


### Add more details 

If you mark information as OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE, SECRET or TOP-SECRET, you need to add more details. 

Always add details like this:

CLASSIFICATION - HANDLING INSTRUCTION 

### Check and use the official list

The UK Government and MOD use a set of standard markings to tell people how to handle and protect information.

There are many official handling instructions and descriptors. 

Examples include:

- RECIPIENTS ONLY for information that must be handled by named individuals on a strict need-to-know basis
- LOCSEN for information that staff engaged overseas cannot access
- PERSONAL for sensitive information that can be linked to an individual

You can [check the full list on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-security-classifications/government-security-classifications-policy-html#additional-markings).
