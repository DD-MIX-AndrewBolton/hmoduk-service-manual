Teams publishing content in Defence are expected to check that content is still correct and needed. The best way to check is to do regular content audits.

## Why you need to audit content

Content audits help you to understand how much content you have, and the quality and value of your content. 

Defence publishes a lot of content in many different places. Too much content makes it harder for people to find the information they need. Content that is no longer correct is confusing and can be dangerous.

When you do regular audits, you:

- improve the quality of content
- deliver better search results
- make it easier and cheaper to manage content


## Where to start 

If your team has never done a content audit, run a workshop to share how we do it in Defence. 

Make sure you include people who: 

- create the content
- own the content
- manage the service or platform
- are experts in the areas your content covers

In your workshop, you can [use the content audit slides]().  

## How to do a content audit

You can follow the 5 steps to doing a content audit in Defence. 

### 1. Agree your goals

It is important to define the goals of your audit. These can be different each time. 

Your goals might be shaped by user research. For example, users have told you that they need: 

- less content
- updated content
- content that is easier to read

You might have new requirements. For example, you have to:

- make sure content reflects new policy or processes
- get evidence of what content is used 
- improve how accessible your content is

Each time you do an audit you can look for content that is out of date or no longer needed. 

Find out [more about accessible content](/accessibility/meet-accessibility-regulations/content-designers/).

### 2. Select the content 

If you have a lot of content, your goals will help you decide where to start. 

Consider starting with a small section or one topic. For example, you could start with a topic such as ‘sustainability’ and work through all related content. 

You can check if some content can be archived without being audited. This is often the case with news articles older than a certain date. If you archive content instead of deleting it, people should still be able to find it.  

For transactional services, like Apply for a medal, it can be difficult to select one area. It is best to audit all of your content from the start to the end of the journey.  

### 3. Collect data

For each piece of content, find out things like: 

- when it was last updated
- who owns it 
- how it is tagged for search

You can use the [content audit template](). 

Most services have a way of checking how often a piece of content is used. Analytics help give you evidence and confidence to delete content that is not used.

Check [how to make decisions based on evidence](/design/make-decisions-based-on-evidence/).

### 4. Assess the quality and value 

Using the [content audit template](), you can decide if content is still useful. For example, out of date or duplicate content adds little value and can sometimes confuse people.

You can record how well your content is written. For example, is it in GOV.UK style and plain language? 

Content designers are familiar with GOV.UK and Defence writing styles. They can assess how easy content is to read.  

If you don’t have a content designer in your team, you can check: 

- how to [write well for your audience](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/writing-for-gov-uk)
- the [GOV.UK style guide](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style)
- how to [design content in Defence](/content/)

For more advice, [join the content community](your-community/content/).

### 5. Make your recommendations

Based on the data you have collected, you can recommend what happens to different pieces of content. 

In Defence, the options are usually: 

1. Keep content as it is
2. Keep it but make changes
3. Merge it with other content
4. Keep it but move it elsewhere
5. Archive it
6. Delete it

You need to work closely with content owners. Remember to share the audit data with them, it shows that your recommendations are based on evidence.

## Ask a question

If you have any questions, email [Content and Transaction Services](). You can also share your feedback and suggestions.
