The Defence Service Manual is created with you, the digital communities and experts across Defence. 

You can suggest content that you would like to be added.

## Send suggestions

Send your suggestions and copies of any existing guidance to [service-manual@digital.mod.uk](mailto:service-manual@digital.mod.uk).

Do not worry about the format or how content is written. 

### What happens next

We will let you know if the content fits in the Defence Service Manual or suggest another place to publish it. 

If your content fits in the Defence Service Manual, we will review it and share our edits with you.

## Get content updated

If you spot content that needs updating or removing, send the details to [service-manual@digital.mod.uk](mailto:service-manual@digital.mod.uk).

You need to include:

- a link to the relevant pages
- details of the change

## What we publish

In the manual, we include things like:

- how to meet service standards in Defence
- how to do your role in Defence
- shared approaches to doing common tasks
- what tools you are allowed to use

Currently, we only publish OFFICIAL information. 

Check [how to classify information](/security-classifications/how-to-classify-information/).

### What we do not publish

We do not include large pieces of content published elsewhere, for example:

- existing sections on GOV.UK, including the [GOV.UK service manual](https://gov.uk/service-manual)
- Ministry of Defence policy and rules

When it is useful, we link to content published elsewhere.
