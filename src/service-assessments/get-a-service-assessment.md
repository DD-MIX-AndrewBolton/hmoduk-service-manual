Find out what kind of service assessment you need and when they happen. 

You can also check how close you are to meeting the GOV.UK Service Standard.

## Check if you need an assessment

There are 2 kinds of service assessments: 

1. Internal assessments with a panel from across Defence.
2. External assessments with a panel from across government.

## Internal assessments

All digital services in the Defence Digital Foundry must have internal assessments. This applies to internal services as well as services for citizens.

Any digital service in Defence can ask for an informal workshop to check how close you are to meeting the GOV.UK Service Standard.

Find out [more about informal workshops](). 

### Book an internal assessment

To book an internal service assessment, you need to [complete the service briefing form]() and send it to [assessments@digital.mod.uk]. 

The internal assessment will take place around [X] weeks after you’ve submitted the form. 


## External assessments 

Your service needs an external assessment if any of these statements apply:  

- getting assessed is a condition of your Cabinet Office spend approval
- it’s a transactional service that’s new or being rebuilt - your spend approval will say whether what you’re doing counts as a rebuild
- it’s a Defence service that will be used by another government department

These rules apply even if your service is internal and will only be used by crown servants.

### Book an external assessment

External service assessments are organised by the Central Digital and Data Office (CDDO). Check [how to book an external service assessment]().


## When assessments happen 

Service assessments happen towards the end of each phase of delivery, excluding discovery. For example, your service will need an assessment to move from alpha into private beta.

## Check if your service is ready 

If you are unsure how close your service is to meeting the GOV.UK Service Standard, you can book an informal review. This is usually a 2 hour workshop. 

You’ll get support and suggestions from experts in areas like user research, accessibility, design and technology.

Informal reviews help your team: 

- check you’re working in the right way in Defence
- understand how close you are to meeting the GOV.UK Service Standard
- prioritise things that get you closer to meeting the standard

To book an informal workshop, you need to [complete the service briefing form]() and send it to [assessments@digital.mod.uk](). 

The workshop will take place around 4 weeks after you’ve submitted the form.
