Find out what kind of service assessment you need and when they happen. 

You can also check how close you are to meeting the GOV.UK Service Standard.

## Check if you need an assessment

There are 2 kinds of service assessments: 

1. Internal assessments with a panel from across Defence.
2. External assessments with a panel from across government.

If you are not sure how close you are to meeting the GOV.UK Service Standard, you can [get informal feedback on your service]().

## Internal assessments

All digital services in the Defence Digital Foundry must have internal assessments. This applies to internal services as well as services for citizens.

### Get an internal assessment

These are the things you need to do and what you can expect from the assessments panel.

## External assessments 

Your service needs an external assessment if any of these statements apply:  

- assessments are a condition of your Cabinet Office spend approval
- your service is transactional and is new or being rebuilt 
- itâ€™s a Defence service that will be used by another government department


These rules apply even if your service is internal and will only be used by crown servants.

Find out [more about external service assessments]().

### Get an external assessment

External service assessments are organised by the Central Digital and Data Office (CDDO). Check [how to book an external service assessment]().


## When assessments happen 

Service assessments happen towards the end of each phase of delivery, excluding discovery. For example, your service will need an assessment to move from alpha into private beta.

Your service will need:

- an alpha assessment before going into private beta
- a beta assessment before going into public beta
- a live assessment to move out of public beta and into live

### What you need to do in each phase

Remind your team what they should be doing in each phase of delivery to meet the GOV.UK Service Standard.
