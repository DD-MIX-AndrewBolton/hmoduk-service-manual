There are 2 kinds of service assessments: 

1. Internal assessments with a panel from across Defence.
2. External assessments with a panel from across government.

## Internal assessments

All digital services in Defence Digital Foundry must have internal assessments. This applies to internal services as well as services for citizens.

### Get an internal assessment

These are the things you need to do and what you can expect from the assessments panel. 

{{ modukcomponent('steps', {
  'items': [
    {
      'item': 'Request an internal service assessment by completing the <a href="">service briefing form</a>.' 
    },
    {
      'item': 'Agree a date for the assessment. This is usually 4 to 6 weeks after you send the form.'
    },
    {
      'item': 'A couple of weeks before the assessment, the panel shares recommendations for things like content and accessibility.'
    },
    {
      'item': 'Your team attends the assessment over a video call.'
    },
    {
      'item': 'Within 5 working days of your assessment, you’ll get a report with met or not met.'
    }
  ]
}) }}

You can check [what happens during and after an assessment](/service-assessments/what-to-expect). 


## External assessments 

Your service needs an external assessment if any of these statements apply:  

- assessments are a condition of your Cabinet Office spend approval
- your service is transactional and is new or being rebuilt 
- it’s a Defence service that will be used by another government department

These rules apply even if your service is internal and will only be used by crown servants.

### Get an external assessment

External service assessments are organised by the Central Digital and Data Office (CDDO). Check [how to book an external service assessment]().


## When assessments happen 

Service assessments happen towards the end of each phase of delivery, excluding discovery. For example, your service will need an assessment to move from alpha into private beta.

Your service will need:

- an alpha assessment before going into private beta
- a beta assessment before going into public beta
- a live assessment to move out of public beta and into live

## What you need to do in each phase

Remind your team what they should be doing in each phase of delivery to meet the GOV.UK Service Standard. 

Check GOV.UK guidance on:

- [discovery](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-discovery-phase-works)
- [alpha](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-alpha-phase-works) 
- [beta](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-beta-phase-works) 
- [live](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-live-phase-works)

If you are not sure how close you are to meeting the GOV.UK Service Standard, you can [get feedback on your service](/service-assessments/get-feedback-on-your-service).
