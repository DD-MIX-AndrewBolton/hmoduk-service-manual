Some digital services in Defence are assessed against the GOV.UK Service Standard. This includes internal services as well as services for citizens.

## Check if you need an assessment

In Defence, you must get your service assessed if either of these statements apply:

- getting assessed is a condition of your Cabinet Office spend approval
- it’s a transactional service that’s new or being rebuilt 

Other kinds of governance, like Secure by Design and Joint Service Publications (JSPs), might still apply to your service. 

If you are unsure, check with your service owner.

### Transactional services 

Your service is transactional if it allows users to either:

- exchange information, money, permission, goods or services
- submit personal information that results in a change to a government record

## When you need an assessment

Service assessments happen towards the end of each phase of delivery. For example, your service will need an assessment to move from alpha into beta and from beta into public beta or live. 

## Book an assessment

Assessments are organised by the Central Digital and Data Office (CDDO) or the Ministry of Defence. 

### More than 100,000 transactions

If your service is likely to have more than 100,000 transactions a year, your assessments are organised by the Central Digital and Data Office (CDDO). 

Check [how to book an assessment with CDDO](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments/book-a-service-assessment). 

### Fewer than 100,000 transactions

If your service is likely to have fewer than 100,000 transactions a year, your assessments are organised by the Ministry of Defence. 

To book an assessment, email [assessments@digital.mod.uk](mailto:assessments@digital.mod.uk?subject=Book%20a%20service%20assessment). 

You can also ask for an informal review of your service. Getting advice from peers can help you identify areas of risk early and prepare for an assessment.
