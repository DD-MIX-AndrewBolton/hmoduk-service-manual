In a service assessment, your digital service is reviewed by a panel of trained assessors. It is an approach used across government.

## Deliver the right thing for users 

All teams creating digital services for Defence should meet the [GOV.UK Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard). This applies to internal services as well as services for citizens. 

Service assessments help you: 

- validate the problem your service aims to solve
- apply the GOV.UK Service Standard in Defence
- work in the right way for users from the start
- consider the end-to-end journey across Defence

For example, in an alpha assessment you’ll share how you validated user needs to focus on the right problem.

Find out more about [applying the GOV.UK Service Standard in Defence](https://servicemanual.digital.mod.uk/meet-the-standard/).

## Follow established ways of working 

Service assessments help ensure public money is spent wisely. This includes reusing approaches and patterns to deliver digital services quickly.

Service assessments help you check you are:

- following best practices used in Defence and across government  
- making the most of existing components and patterns

For example, in a beta assessment the panel might suggest you contact a team that has  solved a similar problem. 
 
## Share experiences across Defence

In an assessment, your team gets to showcase the great work you’re doing on your service. This helps shape better ways of working across Defence.

People on the assessment panel have worked on digital services in Defence and  government departments. They will offer different perspectives and suggest things that have worked elsewhere.

For example, in a live assessment the panel might suggest ways to increase adoption or support assisted digital users. 

## Become a service assessor

Training to be a service assessor will help you: 

- understand the service standards
- learn from what other services are doing
- create great digital services

You’ll also join the assessor community across government. 

### Who can get training

You need to be a crown servant in Defence who has worked on a digital service for at least 6 months. 

This includes anyone who has just joined Defence but has digital experience in another government department. 

If you meet these criteria, send your details to [assessments@digital.mod.uk](mailto:assessments@digital.mod.uk?subject=Service%20assessor%20training). 

We would like to hear from trained assessors across Defence. You can join the panel for internal service assessments.
