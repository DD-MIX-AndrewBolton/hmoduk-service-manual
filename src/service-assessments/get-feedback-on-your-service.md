Any digital service in Defence can ask for a feedback session with peers and experts. 

Feedback sessions are informal. You can ask for a feedback session at any time, even if your service is not being assessed. 

## How feedback helps 

Getting informal feedback from others helps your team: 

- design and deliver great digital services
- learn from people in user-centred design roles across Defence
- work towards meeting the GOV.UK Service Standard

You do not need to prepare anything for an informal feedback session. You just need to chat through your service and any user research findings. 

## Ask for specific feedback

When you book a feedback session, be clear about what you would like help with. 

For example, you might want to know if there are existing patterns you can reuse or how other services manage SECRET information.

Consider what youâ€™d like to know in areas like:  

- Service design
- Interaction design
- Graphic design
- Content design
- Accessibility
- Technology

Feedback sessions do not replace the need for a multidisciplinary team. You can [find out more about multidisciplinary teams](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/point-6-have-a-multidisciplinary-team).

## Book a feedback session 

All sessions are run remotely over video calls. Sessions last for 90 minutes. 

To book a feedback session, email [assessments@digital.mod.uk](mailto:assessments@digital.mod.uk?subject=Book%20a%20feedback%20session)
