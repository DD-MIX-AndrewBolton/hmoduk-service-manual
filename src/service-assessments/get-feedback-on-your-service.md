Any digital service in Defence can ask for a feedback session with peers and experts. 

Feedback sessions are informal, they are not part of a service assessment. 

## How feedback helps 

Getting informal feedback from others helps your team: 

- design and deliver great digital services
- learn from people in user-centred design roles across Defence
- work towards meeting the GOV.UK Service Standard

You do not need to prepare anything for an informal feedback session. You just need to chat through your service and any user research findings. 

## What you can ask for 

All sessions are run remotely over video calls. Sessions last for 90 minutes. 

If you’d like to discuss how close you are to meeting the GOV.UK Service Standard, you can ask for a 2 hour session. 

You can decide what you’d like help with, including areas like: 

- Service design
- Interaction design
- Graphic design
- Content design
- Accessibility
- Technology

Feedback sessions do not replace the need for your team to include people from across the design disciplines.
