If you are not sure how close you are to meeting the GOV.UK Service Standard, you can get informal feedback on your service. 

## How feedback helps

Informal feedback sessions help your team: 

- check you’re working in the right way in Defence
- understand how close you are to meeting the GOV.UK Service Standard
- prioritise roles and activities to help you meet the standard

You’ll get support and suggestions from experts in Defence in areas like user research, accessibility, design and technology. 

## Book a feedback session

Sessions last around 2 hours. We’ll let you know which team members need to attend. 

To book a feedback session, [complete the service briefing form]() and send it to [assessments@digital.mod.uk]().
