Find out what happens at an internal service assessment, including the kind of questions you’ll be asked. You can also check what happens after your assessment.

## During an assessment 

Internal assessments are run by a panel of experienced specialists from the Defence digital community. 

The panel are not there to catch you out. They will do a peer review of the work you’ve done and help you understand anything you need to change or improve.

Panels are normally made up of 4 or 5 assessors, including a:

- lead assessor
- user researcher 
- designer
- technical lead

There might also be one or 2 observers, but they will not ask questions.

Internal assessments take place remotely on a video call. 

You will get the agenda [X] weeks before your assessment. The call usually runs from 10am to 12 noon then 1pm to 3pm with regular breaks.  


## After an assessment 

Your service will be assessed as met or not met.

A met means that the service can continue to the next phase of development. A not met means the service needs to be reassessed against the points the service did not meet.

You’ll get a report with your result and any recommendations within 5 working days of an internal assessment. 

For openness and to help other services, internal assessment reports are published in the reports section of this manual. You’ll have the chance to fact check it before it’s published.

You can [find external assessment reports published on GOV.UK]().


## Who needs to be at the assessment

Make sure the right people from your team are available for the assessment. Who needs to be there depends on your service and the phase you are in. You’ll get advice when you book your assessment. 

People who need to be at assessments include your:

- service owner
- delivery manager
- user researcher 
- lead developer 

In alpha and beta assessments, you might also need your:

- service designer 
- interaction designer 
- content designer

In beta and live assessments you’ll need a performance analyst or someone who can present the number and type of users. 

## What you’ll be asked at each phase

Your team will be asked different questions depending on the phase you are in. 

In an alpha assessment, your service designer might be asked how you know you’ve got the scope of the service right. In a live assessment, your performance analyst might be asked how you’re using data to improve your service?
