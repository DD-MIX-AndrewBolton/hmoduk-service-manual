Find out what happens before, during and after a service assessment, including the kind of questions your team will be asked. 

## Before an assessment

If your assessment is organised by the Ministry of Defence, you’ll be invited to meet the assessment panel before your assessment.  

The panel might also share some recommendations with you in areas like technology, content and accessibility. 

### What you should be doing at each phase

Remind your team what they should be doing in your phase of delivery to meet the GOV.UK Service Standard. 

Check GOV.UK guidance on:

- [discovery](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-discovery-phase-works)
- [alpha](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-alpha-phase-works) 
- [beta](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-beta-phase-works) 
- [live](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-live-phase-works)

### Who needs to be at the assessment

Make sure the right people from your team are available for the assessment. 

Who needs to be there depends on your service and the phase you are in. You’ll get advice when you book your assessment.

### Questions your team will be asked 

Your team will be asked different questions depending on the phase you are in.  

As a team, run through example questions for:

- [an alpha assessment](/service-assessments/what-to-expect/questions-in-an-alpha-assessment)
- [a beta assessment](/service-assessments/what-to-expect/questions-in-a-beta-assessment)
- [a live assessment](/service-assessments/what-to-expect/questions-in-a-live-assessment)


## During an assessment 

Assessments are run by a panel of experienced specialists from the Defence digital community. 

The panel are not there to catch you out. They will do a peer review of the work you’ve done and help you understand anything you need to change or improve.

Panels are normally made up of 4 or 5 assessors, including a:

- lead assessor
- user researcher 
- designer
- technical lead

There might also be one or 2 observers, but they will not ask questions.

Assessments take place in person or remotely on a video call.  


## After an assessment 

Your service will be assessed as met or not met.

A met means that the service can continue to the next phase of development. 

A not met means the service needs to be reassessed against the points the service did not meet.

You’ll get a report with your result and any recommendations within 5 working days of your assessment.
