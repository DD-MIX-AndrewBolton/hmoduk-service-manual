The people on the assessment panel do not know your service like you do. In an assessment, you’ll only have around 40 minutes to describe:

- the problem you’re trying to solve
- how your service fits with other products and services
- what tasks your users need to do 

It’s important to present your service in a clear and engaging way.

## Describe your service

Everyone in the team should be able to describe your service if asked. You need to agree how to describe your service in one or two sentences. 

This is a good example: 

The Apply for a veteran’s ID card service allows users to confirm that someone has served in the UK armed forces in a one-off, simple process, so veterans can access the services they are entitled to.

## Tell an engaging story 

Do not simply list the 14 points in the GOV.UK Service Standard. 

As you describe and demo your service, tell the panel about things like:  

- how users responded in user testing
- an area where you improved accessibility 
- a design challenge and how the team worked to solve it
- reusing patterns or approaches from other government departments 

If you have analytics, include some of the numbers in your story. For example, by improving content on the start page you increased the number of users completing a form successfully by 11%. 

Consider letting a few of your team tell the story of your service. The panel will appreciate hearing from the different experts on your team.

## Collect things as they happen

You should not need to spend a long time preparing for your internal assessment. 

Do just enough to make sure you can give an open and honest account of the work you’ve done and what you’ve built.

You can reuse things from your show and tells. It also helps to record things you are doing as they happen, for example:

- create a folder for photos from workshops and site visits
- select short videos from user research sessions
- take before and after screenshots when you improve something

Make sure you have consent from anyone featured in a photo or video.
