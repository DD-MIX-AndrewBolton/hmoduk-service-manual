There are a few things you should do when you meet with users and stakeholders in Defence.

## Encourage people to speak freely 

Give participants respect and autonomy. Give people time to think and to respond - do not hurry or correct them.

When testing your service, remind users that you are not testing them and that there are no wrong responses. If you can, arrange to meet with users without the people they report to being present. 

## Take steps to reduce bias

Do not let your own experiences and opinions affect conversations. Use inclusive language and mirror how someone describes their experiences.

You should also try to minimise your physical and verbal reactions to comments. For example, nodding, frowning or saying if you agree or disagree.

If you are discussing something that you have strong opinions on, consider sending someone else. 

## Avoid triggering trauma

In Defence, you are likely to meet some people who have experienced trauma or are suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). 

If someone starts describing past trauma that is not related to your discussion, politely interrupt and acknowledge what they have said. Ask if they would like to take a break or stop the session. You can also ask if they would like links to any support available.  

## Manage remote sessions well

Do not use personal devices or accounts to run remote sessions. If you are contacting user research participants by phone, withhold your number and let them know that this will happen. 

People have the right to drop off a remote session at any time. If someone leaves while discussing something sensitive or upsetting, contact them straight away to check if they need any support.
