When you meet with users and stakeholders, you are expected to do so ethically. 

## Why ethics are important

Ethics includes things like:

- approaching people in the right way
- representing peoples’ views correctly
- dealing with sensitive issues 

You need to be ethical when you do user research with members of the public or people in Defence. 

You should also consider ethics when meeting with stakeholders, presenting your service and running workshops.

## Help with ethical issues 

If you have an ethical concern related to someone in the military, do not raise it directly with their superior. 

Discuss your concerns confidentially with your delivery lead or product owner. If they are unsure, raise it confidentially with your Head of Profession.

### Ministry of Defence Research Ethics Committee
