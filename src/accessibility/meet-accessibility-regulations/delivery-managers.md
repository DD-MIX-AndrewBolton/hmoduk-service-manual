To create digital products or services that anyone in Defence can use, you need to make accessibility part of delivery. For example, discussing potential accessibility issues as features are designed.

## Plan work on accessibility

When your team plans and estimates work, allow time to make designs accessible and test that they are.

Testing for accessibility should include:

- how your product or service works with assistive technologies
- checking against the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" target="_blank">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1)<span class="govuk-visually-hidden">opens in a new tab</span></a>

If your service needs an [accessibility statement](/accessibility/publishing-documents#accessibility-statements), you will need time to create or update it. 


## Definition of ready

The definition of ready is a list of things that are needed before something can be started.

In your team’s definition of ready, include things like:

- error messages, page titles and URLs agreed with a Content Designer
- additional descriptions or ‘alt tags’ agreed with a Content Designer
- design reviewed by the team and accessibility issues discussed
- updates to the accessibility statement

Before work starts on a story or ticket, ask an Interaction Designer and a Content Designer what is needed to make designs accessible.

## Definition of done

The definition of done is a list of things that must be done to consider something finished. This should include automated and manual testing for any accessibility issues.

In your team’s definition of done, include things like checked using:

- a screen reader
- a screen magnifier
- speech recognition

You need to correct any issues or explain them in the [accessibility statement](/accessibility/publishing-documents#accessibility-statements).
