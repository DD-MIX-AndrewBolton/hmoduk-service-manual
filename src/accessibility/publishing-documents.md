## Publish accessible documents

Any documents you include in your service, such as PDFs, must be accessible. Check the guidance on [publishing accessible documents](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/publishing-accessible-documents/).

If you need help to make documents accessible, on a MOD device contact the [Directorate of Defence Communications](https://modgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/IntranetHeadOffice/SitePages/Defence-Communications.aspx).

## Accessibility statements

An accessibility statement tells people who use a service how accessible it is and how to get help with accessibility issues. 

{{ component('warning-text', {
  text: "Legally, all digital services used by the public must have an accessibility statement.",
  iconFallbackText: "Warning"
}) }}

### Internal services

If your digital service is only used by people in Defence, check if they need an accessibility statement. 

Reasons to publish an accessibility statement on an internal service include: 

- users are able to request content in different formats
- you are still working on making areas of your service accessible 

{{ component('inset-text', {
  text: 'Your digital service must meet accessibility regulations even if you do not publish an accessibility statement.'
}) }}

Check [how to meet accessibility regulations](/accessibility/meet-accessibility-regulations/).

### What you need to include

If your service needs an accessibility statement, it needs to cover:

- whether your website or mobile app is fully, partially or not compliant with accessibility standards
- if it’s not fully compliant, which parts do not meet accessibility standards and why. For example, because they are exempt or it would be a disproportionate burden to fix
- how people can get alternatives to content that’s not accessible to them
- how to contact you to report accessibility problems - and a link to the website that they can use if they’re not happy with your response

### Explain things that are exempt

You need to explain that things that are not accessible because they are exempt. This includes:

- live audio and video
- third party content under someone else’s control
- maps but essential information, like addresses, must be accessible

Check the guidance on [publishing an accessibility statement](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/make-your-website-or-app-accessible-and-publish-an-accessibility-statement/).

### Create an accessibility statement

Use this [model accessibility statement](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/model-accessibility-statement/).

If you can, work with a content designer to make sure the content you add is written in plain English.
