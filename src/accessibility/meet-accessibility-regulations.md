## Accessibility by design 

Creating accessible digital services is important for all users, not just people with physical disabilities or cognitive impairments. 

Anyone using your service can find themselves dealing with a stressful situation, tiredness or illness.

When you start designing a digital service or product, you need to plan for accessibility. 

## Check the regulations

In the UK, every government digital service for citizens or internal users must:

- meet level AA of the <a href="https://w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" target="_blank">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1) <span class="govuk-visually-hidden">(opens in a new tab)</span></a> as a minimum
- work on the most commonly used assistive technologies, including screen magnifiers, screen readers and speech recognition tools
- include people with disabilities in user research

Some services also need an [accessibility statement](/accessibility/publishing-documents#accessibility-statements/).

Check the guidance on <a href="https://gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps/" target="_blank">accessibility for public sector bodies <span class="govuk-visually-hidden">(opens in a new tab)</span></a>.

### This applies to everyone

Anyone creating digital services or products for Defence, including third-party suppliers, must make sure they meet UK accessibility regulations. 

## Your role in accessibility

Everyone in a digital design and delivery team plays a part in accessibility.

For Developers to build an accessible service, designs and content need to work with assistive technology. Delivery Managers need to plan time to test with assistive technologies.
