## Accessibility by design 

Plan for accessibility as soon as you start designing a digital service or product. 

Accessibility is important for all users, not just people with physical disabilities or cognitive impairments. Anyone using your service can find themselves dealing with a stressful situation, tiredness or illness.

A service that is easy to use and understand is better for everyone.

## Check the regulations

In the UK, all government digital services and products must:

- meet level AA of the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) as a minimum
- work on the most commonly used assistive technologies, including screen magnifiers, screen readers and speech recognition tools
- include people with disabilities in user research

Some services also need an [accessibility statement](/accessibility/publishing-documents#accessibility-statements/).

Check the guidance on [accessibility for public sector bodies](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps/).

### This applies to everyone

Anyone creating digital services or products for Defence, including third-party suppliers, must make sure they meet UK accessibility regulations. 

## Your role in accessibility

Everyone in a digital design and delivery team plays a part in accessibility.

For Developers to build an accessible service, designs and content need to work with assistive technology. Delivery Managers need to plan time to test with assistive technologies.
