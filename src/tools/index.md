Monica testing - All tools and software that you use in Defence must be secure and meet data protection regulations. 

{{ modukcomponent('do-dont-list', {
  'title': 'Do',
  'type': 'tick',
  'items': [
    {
      'item': 'Check what tools and software you can use in Defence.'
    }
  ]
}) }}

{{ modukcomponent('do-dont-list', {
  'title': 'Donâ€™t',
  'type': 'cross',
  'items': [
    {
      'item': 'set up personal software accounts for work in Defence.'
    }
  ]
}) }}

## What you can use

You should use tools that have a Ministry of Defence (MOD) licence, for example:

- Conceptboard
- GitHub
- Google Workspace
- JIRA
- Slack
- Trello 

{{ component('inset-text', {
  text: 'Do not set up personal software accounts for work in Defence. There may be risks to your security and we cannot access work if you leave.'
}) }}

### Ask for access 

If you are part of Digital Foundry and need access to MOD tools, [use the service request form](https://defencedigital.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/6).


## Check what others are using

If the tool you would like to use is not listed, check if other teams in Defence are already using it or something similar.  For example, the:

- user research community has some approved tools for remote research
- design community uses a shared MOD Figma account

You can: 

- [check with your community](/your-community/)
- [ask on Defence Digital Slack](https://defencedigital.slack.com/archives/C02GUNVHBBL)

On a MOD device, you can use Slack in your web browser.

## What you must not use

Some tools have been assessed and are not suitable for use in Defence. For example, you must not use MIRO.

If you are recruiting participants for user research, you must not use social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn and TikTok.

If you are unsure, [ask on Defence Digital Slack](https://defencedigital.slack.com/archives/C02GUNVHBBL).

On a MODNET device, you can use Slack in your web browser.
