## What you can use

All tools and software that you use in Defence must be secure and meet data protection regulations. 

For example, you can use MOD accounts for:

- JIRA
- Trello
- Conceptboard
- Git

{{ component('inset-text', {
  text: 'Do not use personal accounts of any software for work in Defence. There may be risks to your security and we cannot access work if you leave.'
}) }}

### Ask for access 

To get access to MOD accounts, ask in the [support channel on Defence Digital Slack](https://defencedigital.slack.com/archives/C02GUNVHBBL). 

On a MODNET device, you can use Slack in your web browser.

When you ask for access, include:

- your full name 
- the project or service you’re working on
- the tool you need access to
- your email address

## Check what others are using

You should check what tools others are using in Defence. For example, the:

- user research community has some approved tools for remote research
- design community uses a shared Figma account

You can: 

- check with [your community](/your-community/)
- ask in the [support channel on Defence Digital Slack](https://defencedigital.slack.com/archives/C02GUNVHBBL)

## What you must not use

Some tools have been assessed and are not suitable for use in Defence. For example, you must not use MIRO.

If you are recruiting participants for user research, you must not use social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn and TikTok.
