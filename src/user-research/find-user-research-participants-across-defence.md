Participants are the people who take part in user research. They should be people who are using or will use your service or product.

## Check what has already been done

User researchers across Defence must avoid doing similar research with the same groups of participants. 

Before starting user research, ask the user-centred design (UCD) community if there is existing data you can use.

Check [how to contact the UCD community](/your-community/user-centred-design/).


## Start with stakeholders and subject matter experts

Your stakeholders will understand how Defence works. Working with them to find participants can be more efficient than trying to find them yourself.

They can help you:

- find participants across Defence
- follow the correct process
- navigate the various MOD organisations

### Follow the chain of command

Some people need approval from their commanding officer to take part in research. Reaching out directly to some participants may break the chain of command.

Your stakeholders can help you follow the chain of command and avoid problems.

### Tools that can help

#### MODNET

If you have access to MODNET, you can often find staff names and details on your Command Sharepoint. If you do not have access to this or other platforms, ask a permanent staff member to help you.

#### Staff directories

Use staff directories to find colleagues in the Ministry of Defence (MOD).

## Use MOD networks

You can contact networks directly. You do not need stakeholder involvement or to follow a chain of command.

### Defence Disability Network

You must include people with different disabilities in your research. This helps your service meet the needs of all of its users.

You need to include participants who:

- are disabled or use assistive technologies
- may need help to use your service

The Defence Disability Network (DDN) can help you recruit participants with condition-specific disabilities.

### Defence Connect

Defence Connect is a secure network for “disconnected users”, including:

- reservists
- soldiers and officers without MODNET access
- people working off base

You can use Defence Connect to:

- recruit participants for one-to-one research
- send out randomised surveys and questionnaires

### Army Knowledge Exchange

Army Knowledge Exchange (AKX) is an Army resource for sharing knowledge, lessons and good practice for doctrine, force development and training.

You can use it to recruit research participants from the British Army.

### Trusted Voices

MOD staff use aliases on Trusted Voices to discuss sensitive topics like pay, mental health and bullying.

You can use Trusted Voices to:

- start a discussion on a sensitive topic
- create a questionnaire
