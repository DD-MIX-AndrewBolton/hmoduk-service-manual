## Protect participantsâ€™ data and identities

Before sharing user research findings, in reports or during presentations, remove all information that could be used to identify participants. This includes:

- names
- contact details
- real data entered in a prototype

If you have participants from a small team or area in Defence, consider what other information could give away their identity. It could be things like their job title or ethnic background.

  text: 'You must never share personal, sensitive or real data in documents or presentations.'
}) }}

For projects that present personal or sensitive data, ask your team to create dummy data that can be shared.

Find out [how to make user research data anonymous](/user-research/save-and-store-user-research-data/).

### Recording presentations

Even if a participant has agreed that you can use a video recording, make sure they are comfortable sharing the clips you have chosen.

If you are recording a session including videos of participants, pause the recording while you show the clips. We cannot control how widely recordings are shared. They may be used in ways that are not covered in the consent form.

Check [what we cover in consent forms](/user-research/save-and-store-user-research-data#keep-your-promises-to-participants/).

## How to share your findings 

Sharing your findings helps avoid doing similar research with the same participants. It also helps other projects reuse existing research.

### Sharing across Defence

You need to share your findings across Defence. 

You can do things like: 

- chat through your findings on community calls
- send your report to relevant MOD networks
- ask to present at Defence events
- post a link to your report on [Defence Digital Service Slack](https://defencedigital.slack.com)

### Sharing across Government

If you can share your findings outside MOD, consider:

- posting a link to your report on [UK Government Digital Slack](https://ukgovernmentdigital.slack.com)
- writing a post for the [Defence Digital blog](https://defencedigital.blog.gov.uk/)
