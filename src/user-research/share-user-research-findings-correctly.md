We need to avoid doing similar research with the same participants and help projects reuse existing research.

## Protect participants’ data and identities

Before sharing user research findings, in reports or during presentations, remove all information that could be used to identify participants. This includes:

- names
- contact details
- real data entered in a prototype

If you have participants from a small team or area, consider what other information could give away their identity. It could be things like their job title or ethnic background.

If your service presents personal or sensitive data, ask your team to create dummy data that can be shared.

Find out [how to make user research data anonymous](/user-research/save-and-store-user-research-data/).

### Pause recordings during meetings

Even if a participant has agreed that you can use a video recording, make sure they are comfortable sharing the clips you have chosen.

If you record meetings that include videos of participants, pause the recording while you show the clips.

We cannot control how widely recordings are shared. They may be used in ways that are not covered in the consent form.

Check [what we cover in consent forms](/user-research/save-and-store-user-research-data#keep-your-promises-to-participants/).

## How to share your findings 

### Sharing across Defence

You need to share your findings across Defence. 

You can do things like: 

- chat through your findings on community calls
- send your report to relevant MOD networks
- ask to present at Defence events

### Sharing across Government

If you can share your findings outside MOD, consider writing a post for the [Defence Digital blog](https://defencedigital.blog.gov.uk/).
