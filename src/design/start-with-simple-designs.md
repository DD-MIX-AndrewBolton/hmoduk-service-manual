Make sure your service is easy to use by starting simply and using existing patterns.


## Services for users in Defence

You need to reuse components and patterns already used in Defence. 

Before you start, [check the MOD.UK Design System]().

It helps you build services that are:

- consistent with other Defence services
- accessible
- easy to maintain

## Services for citizens

If your service is for members of the public or hosted on GOV.UK, [use the GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/).

It helps you build services that:

- are familiar to citizens 
- consistent with other GOV.UK services


## Using images and videos

Before adding images and videos to your service, get evidence that your users need them to complete a task. 

If your users do not understand written content, try to improve it before creating a video. Videos are expensive to make and difficult to change.

{{ component('inset-text', {
  text: 'All images and videos in your service must be accessible.'
}) }}

Find out [more about designing for accessibility](/accessibility/meet-accessibility-regulations/interaction-designers/).

### Official images and videos

If your users need images or videos, [check the MOD library](https://www.defenceimagery.mod.uk/). 

You can use images and videos from the library for anything related to Defence without worrying about licences or copyright.
