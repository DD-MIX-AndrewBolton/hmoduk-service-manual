Make sure your service is easy to use by starting simply and using existing patterns.


## Services for users in Defence

You need to reuse patterns and components already used in Defence. 

Before you start, [check MOD.UK Frontend]().

It helps you build services that are:

- consistent with other Defence services
- accessible
- easy to maintain

## Services for citizens

If your service is for members of the public or hosted on GOV.UK, [use the GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/).

It helps you build services that:

- are familiar to citizens 
- consistent with other GOV.UK services


## Official images and videos

If your users need images or videos to help them complete a task, [select official MOD images or videos](https://www.defenceimagery.mod.uk/). 

The images and videos are owned by MOD. You can use them for anything related to MOD without worrying about licences or copyright. 

{{ component('inset-text', {
  text: 'Avoid adding images or videos if your users do not need them. When you add images or videos, make sure they are accessible.'
}) }}
