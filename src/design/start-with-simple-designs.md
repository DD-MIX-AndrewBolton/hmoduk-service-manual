Starting with simple designs and iterating based on user research will keep your service or product as simple as possible.

You should also check:

- the [GOV.UK design principles](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles)
- [designing good government services: an introduction](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/introduction-designing-government-services)

## Check existing patterns

Existing patterns and components have usually been tested with users. They are likely to be responsive and meet accessibility requirements.

Start by checking the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk).

You can adapt an existing pattern or component. Make sure you:

- follow the [GOV.UK design principles](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles)
- share what you are doing with the [MOD user-centred design community](/your-community/user-centred-design/)
- work with a User Researcher to test the designs

## Use correct styles

### Defence Digital styles

Use these for services or products hosted:

- internally, such as on an intranet
- publicly on foundry.digital.mod.uk

To get Defence Digital styles, [get in touch with the MOD design system team](#0).

### GOV.UK styles

Use these for services or products hosted publicly on GOV.UK.

## Use offical images and videos

If your users need images or videos to help them understand something, [select official MOD images or videos](https://www.defenceimagery.mod.uk/). 

The images and videos are owned by MOD. You can use them for anything related to MOD without worrying about licences or copyright. 

For accessibility, avoid adding images or videos if your users do not need them.
