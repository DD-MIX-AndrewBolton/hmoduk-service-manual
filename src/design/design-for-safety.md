Good design keeps people safe. Make sure your service or product is reliable and easy to understand in stressful situations.

## Consider safety from the start

The Ministry of Defence has to provide safe equipment, systems and services.

To create safe services, you need to: 

- understand the environments your users are in
- check how service failures might impact users
- address any safety concerns

## Test in real or simulated environments

You should test your service or product with real users in the place that they use it. In Defence, this is not always possible.

You can also test in:

- a lab simulating the real environment
- a similar environment, such as a training ground

### Talk to people in similar environments

Working with people who have experience in similar environments can help. They can:

- use their experience to identify safety issues
- describe their environment and any restrictions

## Make it easy to report issues

Defence users need to report safety issues as soon as possible. Acting on feedback quickly keeps people safe.

For example: if your service will be used in combat zones at night, but does not work in low light, it will put users in danger.

### Check your feedback processes

As part of your existing feedback processes, make sure users can report any concerns about the safety of your product or service.

To send feedback, Defence users might need:

- permission from their commanding officer
- a process that works in thier environment

### Prioritise feedback based on risk

When you get feedback, make sure high risk problems and safety issues are easy to identify. This will help you respond to them quickly.

For example: if you collect feedback using an online form, let users select the level of risk associated with the problem.
