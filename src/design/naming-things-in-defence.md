Get the user-centred design specialists on your team involved in naming your service or product. 

When you have a name that works best for users, it should be approved by your service or product owner.

## Start with the GOV.UK approach

If your service or product is hosted on GOV.UK, you need to meet their naming standards. 

For services hosted internally or elsewhere, the GOV.UK approach is still recommended.

According to GOV.UK, good service or product names:

- use the words users use
- are based on analytics and user research
- describe a task, not a technology
- do not need to change when policy or technology changes
- are verbs, not nouns

Check the [GOV.UK guidance on naming your service](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/naming-your-service).

## Acronyms in service names

It is always best to avoid acronyms in service names. This can sometimes be difficult in Defence. 

The GOV.UK approach recommends using the words your users use. Your users might use familiar or internationally recognised acronyms, for example MOD and NATO. 

{{ component('inset-text', {
  text: 'Do not include unfamiliar acronyms or code names in your service or product name. '
}) }}

### Test without acronyms

Even in Defence, many service names do not need to include acronyms. You should test service names without acronyms first. 

If you have evidence that users are familiar with an acronym and need it in your service name, you will not fail a service assessment.

### Writing acronyms in service names 

If users need a familiar acronym in your service name, do not write it out in full. This creates long service names and can confuse people. 


## Example service names 

All service names should use a verb to describe the task that users are doing. 

Good examples of service names in Defence include:

- Estimate your armed forces pension
- Get a copy of military service records
- Apply for a medal or veterans badge
